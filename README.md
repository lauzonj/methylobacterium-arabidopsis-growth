# methylobacterium-arabidopsis-growth

This repository contains all data and scripts needed for reproducing all statistical analyses and figures of the article "Richness and composition of phyllosphere Methylobacterium communities cause variation in Arabidopsis thaliana growth".

## Notes on dataframes

### biom_data.csv

diversity : strains richness (number of strains)\n
comm : community composition (each letter refer to a different strain; see below)\n
leaf_biom : leaf dry biomass (mg)\n
molds : presence of molds on plant and/or medium\n
shelf_x : position coordinates on shelves in growth chamber\n
shelf_y : position coordinates on shelves in growth chamber\n

### arabi_synthcomms.csv

A to L : proportion (relative abundance) of each strain in the community associated with a plant.
